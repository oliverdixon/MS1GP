\subsection{Introductory examples}
Now that we have established an axiomatic definition of the category, the
natural next step is the exploration of some simple examples of category theory
in action. In this section, we will cover multiple categories with objects and
morphisms that are already familiar to us and not too daunting. This will make
us more comfortable with the more fleshed out examples coming later in this
report.

For the first three of these examples, the objects of our categories will be
nothing but sets and morphisms nothing but functions (both with some additional
restrictions). However, it's important to remember that categories need not
contain functions nor sets. In fact, we will see this in our final introductory
example, where we do away with both entirely!

All of the examplary categories that we are going to touch on will be infinite.
This means that we won't be using any diagrams for this section of the report.

\subsection{The category of sets}
An easy to digest example to start is the category of sets, whose objects are sets and
morphisms are functions between sets. These are the set-theoretic functions we
are familiar with and have been using throughout the Autumn Term. We will follow
the common denotation [REF] for this category: $\catset$.

We can easily verify that this category indeed satisfies the category axioms
seen in [AXIOMSREF].
\begin{itemize}
        \item There are objects, which are sets.
        \item There are morphisms between those objects, which are functions.
                Remember, however: morphisms are not necessarily functions! In fact,
                in most applications of category theory, it is rare that we see
                functions as morphisms. (REF)
        \item The composition of two functions is also a function, with its
                domain and codomain coming from the functions involved in the
                composition operation. Hence the axiom of composition is
                satisfied.
        \item Let $A \in \mathrm{ob} ( \catset )$. We have that the identity
                morphism for $A$ is $(1_A \colon A \to A) \in \mathrm{ob} ( \catset )$.
        \item The morphisms of $\catset$ are associative because functions are
                associative. Let $A,B,C,D \in \mathrm{ob} ( \catset )$ be distinct. Also, let
                $f \in \mathrm{hom} (A, B)$, $g \in \mathrm{hom} (B, C)$, and $h \in
                \mathrm{hom} (C, D)$. By function associativity, we have that
                \begin{equation*}
                        ( f \circ g ) \circ h = f \circ ( g \circ h ).
                \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
Going forwards, we won't be so pedantic by stating facts that are trivially
true.

\subsection{The category of partially ordered sets}
A nice path to advance down is the exploration of a category whose objects are
sets that satisfy certain properties. In other words, these are sets that have
additional structure imposed upon them. We will also assign functions that
preserve this structure to be the morphisms of our category.

In this case, let's think about partially ordered sets, or \emph{posets}. We
must first establish
some definitions:
\begin{itemize}
        \item A poset is a set, $A$, with a relation, $\sim_A$, that is
                reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric. We covered these properties in
                the Autumn Term.
        \item Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A monotone map, $m \colon A \to B$, is an
                order-preserving function such that
                \begin{equation*}
                        ( \forall a, b \in A. \  a \sim_A b )
                        \implies ( m(a) \sim_B m(b) ).
                \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
We have a category $\catpos$ whose objects are posets and morphisms are monotone
maps betwen those posets. The identity morphism exists for all objects due to
the reflexivity of $\sim_A$, and composition follows similarly due to
transitivity.

\subsection{The category of vector spaces}
We can look to linear algebra to provide another simple infinite category. The
category of finite-dimensional $\mathbb{R}$\emph{-vector spaces} is denoted
$\catfinvect$. Let's establish a couple more definitions:
\begin{itemize}
        \item A finite-dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-vector space is an element of
$               \{ \mathbb{R} ^n \, | \, n \in \mathbb{N} \}$.
        \item A linear map is a function, $f$, between two vector spaces, such
                such that vector addition and scalar multiplication is
                preserved. That is,
                \begin{alignat*}{2}
                        f(\vec{u}+\vec{v}) &= f(\vec{u})+f(\vec{v});
                        \qquad && \text{[\textbf{Additivity}]} \\
                        f(\lambda\vec{u}) &= \lambda f(\vec{u}),
                        \qquad && \text{[\textbf{Homogeinity}]}
                \end{alignat*}
                with $\exists n \in \mathbb{N}. \  \vec{u},\vec{v}\in \mathbb{R} ^n
                \text{ and } \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$.
\end{itemize}
