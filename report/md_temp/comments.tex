\begin{itemize}
        \item Line 1: Typo: ``Category'', not ``cateogory''. Please ensure that
        your editor has access to a working spell-checker.

        \item Line 1: Typo: ``Non-symmetric'', not ``non-symetric''.

        \item Line 2: The verbal form of ``abstract'' sounds strange here. I
        would also suggest incorporating this sentence as a secondary clause
        elsewhere, to avoid an interruption in the reading flow.

        \item Line 3: Typo: ``conceive'', not ``concieve''.

        \item Line 3: Typo: ``fulfil'', not ``fulfill'' (the latter is the US
        spelling).

        \item Lines 3--4: ``Either or neither objects and morphisms...'': this
        is very difficult to read.

        \item Line 6: TeX comments are prefixed with a percent symbol (â€˜\%'),
        not a double-oblique.

        \item Line 8: Try to keep the terminology consistent. ``Objects'' and
        ``morphisms'' or ``items'' and ``arrows''?

        \item Line 9: When, exactly, can morphisms be composed? I know that you
        don't want to delve into a discussion of domains and codomains just yet,
        but I still think that there's some room for increased precision here.

        \item Line 12: Perhaps you should mention that these are called
        \textit{commutative diagrams}? Why do they have this name?

        \item Line 14: ``Structure'' is probably more precise than
        ``situation''.  It's also the canonical terminology that'll be used
        throughout the rest of the report, so it's best to introduce it now.

        \item Lines 15--17: Could you try and make this sentence more succinct?
        Something like this may sound better: ``Drawing parallels between
        categories, through the use of functors, often reveals unexpected
        insights to their respective structures, thus giving rise to novel
        techniques in proof and computation.''

        \item Line 16: You have used ``situation'' again. Regardless of the
        appropriateness of this term, try to avoid excessive repetition of
        vocabulary.

        \item Lines 17--18: This doesn't make sense. Are you talking about
        operator analogues in higher- dimensional arithmetic?

        \item Lines 20--21: Can you add a bit of punctuation here? It doesn't
        read well.
