\subsection{The idea of a Category}
A category is a mathematical structure that links a collection of objects with
non-symmetric relationships called morphisms.  Each morphism can be said to
traverse from one object to another.  They are used to create abstract models of
mathematical concepts and structures based on the role each object plays. The
objects and morphisms are extremely versatile in what they can represent as
shown in the commutative diagrams below:

\begin{equation}
        \begin{tikzcd}
                A \ar[r,"\text{Father}"] & B \ar[d,"\text{Brother}"] \\
                D & C \ar[l,"\text{Husband}"]
        \end{tikzcd}
        \begin{tikzcd}
        A
        \end{tikzcd}
        \begin{tikzcd}
        A
        \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
These diagrams are usually used to give a sample of a category to demonstrate
it's properties.  Mathematicians like to generalize with categories and consider
cases with infinite objects and morphisms.  The most valuable mathematical facts
tend to be those that apply to the most situations possible.  For instance,
uncovering the quadratic formula being more important than solving a
particularly difficult quadratic.  It makes all non-trivial quadratics easier to
solve and uncovers a method to determine whether the solutions are real or
complex using the ``$b^2-4ac$'' term.

Morphisms are combined together in a process called composition.  It means to do
one morphism and then another, given that the target object of the first
morphism is the same as the source of the second morphism.  Above we can see
that person $A$ has father person $B$, who has brother person $C$.  We can
compose these two together to have a morphism from $A$ to $C$ which we can could
``uncle''.  These composite morphisms are implied to exist by the diagram and
such are usually redundant to show.  This can be done as many times as one
wants, so if there is a path to traverse from any object to another, there is a
composite morphism between the two.  Hence there is a morphism from $A$ to $D$
which we could call ``uncle in-law''.

There are also identity morphisms.  These go from an object to itself and are
equivalent to not doing a morphism at all, as when they are composed with
another morphism $f$, the resulting composite morphism is equal to $f$.  The
morphism has done nothing, like how multiplying a number by 1(The multiplicative
identity) does not change it's value.  It is similar to stating that something
is equal to itself which is a trivial fact but an important feature of the
structure of categories.  It should be noted that it may not be the only
morphism from one object to itself.

The point of categories is to get more subtle notions of similarity or
``sameness''.
By creating categories we abstract things to their roles and by comparing
categories or spotting patterns and structures within them, we can see
properties shared by things that would initially seem very different.  Lines of
thought in one context can be more easily translated into another by seeing
equivalent structural features.  Mathematicians can then try new methods to
solve problems and prove new facts or describe multiple problems as one that is
more general.
\subsection{Axioms and notation}
We will now formally define a category. The following axioms are necessary for a
structure to be considered a category.
\begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Objects:} In a category $C$ there is $ob(C)$, which is a
        collection of all the objects of $C$.

        \item \textbf{Morphisms:} For each pair ordered pair of objects $(A,B)$
        in a category $C$ we have $hom(A,B)$, also written as $C(A,B)$.  This is
        the collection of all morphisms from A to B, short for ``homomorphism
        set''.  Homomorphisms are those that preserve the structure of objects
        and for many useful categories they are necessary for the axioms to
        hold.  However, this property does not need to hold to use this
        notation.  A morphism $f$ is notated to map $A$ to $B$ by $f: A\to B$.

        \item \textbf{Composition:} For objects $A,B,C\in ob(C)$ if there exists
        morphisms $(f: A\to B)\in hom(A,B)$ and $(g: B\to C)\in hom(B,C)$, then
        there exists $(g\circ f: A\to C)\in hom(A,C)$

        \item \textbf{Identities:} Every object $A$ in a category $C$ has an
        identity morphism which maps from $A$ to itself.  It is notated $1_A:
        A\to A$ for $A\in ob(C), 1_A\in hom(A,A)$.  For $f\in hom(A,B), g\in
        hom(B,A)$ the identity has the property that $f\circ 1_A = f, 1_A\circ g
        = g$ Each identity is unique to it's object. If there was 2 identities
        $I_1,I_2\in A$ then $(f\circ I_1 = f = f\circ I_2) \implies I_1=I_2$

        \item \textbf{Associativity:} A morphism $h\circ(g\circ f) = (h\circ
        g)\circ f$.  This means that two morphisms are equal if they are
        composed from the same morphisms in the same order regardless of the
        order in which we compute the individual composite pairs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Size of categories}
The collection $ob(C)$ and the collections $hom(A,B)$ do not have to be finite.
The idea of category size means to place categories in a hierarchy of
containment. This is to accommodate how $ob(C)$ and $hom(A,B)$ do not have to be
sets either.

When defining an infinite collection of objects by their properties, it can
create contradictions. Famously in set theory there is Russel's paradox.  It
states that if you have a set S that contains every set which doesn't contain
itself, then suppose that S does not contain S, it would imply that S is in fact
in S as it does not contain itself and vice versa.

Formally, $S = \{x\;\text{is a set}\:|\:x\notin x\}, (S\in S) \iff (S\notin S)$.

There were many examples of these paradoxes that were uncovered in the early
20th century. Mathematicians are too rigorous to allow such a thing, so to solve
the issue they devised axiomatic systems to limit the properties that members of
sets can be said to follow.  This makes some sets very convoluted to define and
means there are well defined collections of objects that cannot be put into a
set. Categories address this issue in a more elegant way.  Firstly, categories
do not claim to contain elements; the core concept is instead relationships.
Secondly, categories have a hierarchy of containment such that they only contain
categories ``smaller'' than themselves.  It follows then that categories are not
defined in a self referential manner like in Russel's paradox.

A small category is where $ob(C)$ and each $hom(A,B)$ can be described as a set.
A locally small category is where $ob(C)$ does not form a set but each
$hom(A,B)$ does.

A large category is where nether $ob(C)$ nor $hom(A,B)$ are a set. The hierarchy
means that if you wanted a category where small categories are objects, it would
have to be a large category. Then, if you wanted a category of large categories,
you would need a super-large category and so on. This can be used to formally
think about multiple layers of generalisation and abstraction.

\subsection{Functional Programming: The Problem} In purely functional languages,
there is no allowance for context, or mutable variables of any kind. Each
function must accept some data, perform some strict transformation upon the
data---as defined by the algorithm---and return the result. Whilst this robust
paradigm does open a wide range of mathematical avenues involving proof, safety,
and reproducibility, the prohibition of stateful computation renders many common
tasks, such as system I/O or communication over a network socket, largely
impossible, as these imperatively defined operations inherently contravene the
purity principles of functional programming.

Haskell is a commonly used purely functional programming language, and
suffers, as do all languages in the same class, from this blaring issue.
Indeed, early versions of Haskell did not support the chaining of stateful
computation in any sense, due to the obligatory absence of a fixed execution
order in functional paradigms; programmers were forced to resort to breaking the
purity of the language through aesthetically unpleasant techniques, ultimately
obviating the mathematical essence of the Haskell formal type system.

Category Theory can assist in the solution to this problem, in the form of
monads, which are \emph{monoids in the category of endofunctors}. To unpack this
definition, some more theory needs developing.
