Sets are a familiar structure that, with functions, fit nicely into category
theory. This is easy to demonstrate.

Let $A$ be a set and $f \colon A \to A$ be a function. We will denote $1_A
\coloneqq f$.  Now let $f \colon A \to B$, $y \colon B \to C$, and $h \colon C
\to D$ with $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ being sets. We have that

\begin{equation}
        \left( f \circ g \right) \circ h = f \circ \left( g \circ h \right).
\end{equation}
Hence the category axioms are satisfied, and there is a category whose objects
are all the sets and morphisms are all the functions between those sets. We'll
denote this category Sets moving forwards.
